Spark
-----
* Photon has been announced
* Check out Nest clone as a POC
* SousVide product is built with Spark inside
* Fan in and Fan Out are done with ELB
* Message queueing system pair up the user events from the “API” back and forth with the device cloud
* the constraints of the device limit things like OpenSSL but allow things like CoAP, TropicSSL, RSA+AES. These protocols get the job done but fit within the small hardware footprint
* latency is very important. they strive for less than 100ms response from API to the devices round trip


2lemetry
--------
* PeopleNet. Tracks trucks. Up 9 years
* Can interoperate with legacy tracking systems without change
* intelligent ingestion system “learns” the data protocols and payloads
* Can split payloads so that different streams can be created for sensitive data (HR data, etc)
* http post (webhook), SNS, RedShit, S3, republish on another topic, republish to another account, transform payload
* Stream processing: MQTT: Scala/AKKA, distributed remote actors
* http header is 700-800B.  UDP 2B-4B
* Save 1 bit on every datagram can save them $11,000 for a month of satellite network fees
* QOS 0, 1, 2. 2. Exactly once, can survive network failure, never duplicated
* LWT (last will and testament) can send a final message to another nearby device and can pass it on
* Difference between transient subscription and durable subscription

MachineShop
-----------
* real-time message processing and scalable API management
* Standard APIs for interacting with a heterogeneous product line
* Kafka and Aamza much better than the “bucket brigade” of requesters and workers
